# TR/Selcuk University 3D Printing Dataset


The aim of the study, performed by the TR/Selcuk University Mechanical Engineering Department, was to determine how much of the adjustment parameters in 3d printers affect the print quality, accuracy and strength. There are nine setting parameters and three measured output parameters.

The investigated parameters were:
- Layer Height (mm)
- Wall Thickness (mm)
- Infill Density (%)
- Infill Pattern ()
- Nozzle Temperature (ºC)
- Bed Temperature (ºC)
- Print Speed (mm/s)
- Material ()
- Fan Speed (%)

Outputs were:
- Roughness (µm)
- Tension (ultimate) Strenght (MPa)
- Elongation (%)

In the dataset, the variables are labeled as:
- layer_height
- wall_thickness
- infill_density
- infill_pattern
- nozzle_temperature
- bed_temperature
- print_speed
- material
- fan_speed
- roughness
- tension_strenght
- elongation
