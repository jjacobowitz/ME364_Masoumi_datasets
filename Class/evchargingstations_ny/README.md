Go to https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest to access the full database of alternative fuel station locations nationwide, collected and maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory. A station appears as one point in the data and on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. For EV charging stations for example, the data includes the number of number of charging ports available at the specific station.
